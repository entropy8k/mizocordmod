NSgov_neo_nazis_in_the_goverment_desc:0 "Radical elements have found their way into the halls of power. With extremist ideology seeping into policy and propaganda, the government has grown increasingly unstable. While some see this as a chance to pursue a ‘stronger’ national identity, others fear it will drive the nation into fanaticism and isolation. The influence of these radicals cannot be ignored, and their presence will shape the path ahead — for better or worse."
