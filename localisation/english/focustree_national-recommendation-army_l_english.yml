HAN_armthepeople:0 "Arm The People!"
HAN_armthepeople_desc:0 "The enemies of the nation grow bolder with each passing day. We cannot rely solely on a standing army — the people themselves must rise to defend their homeland. By distributing weapons to loyal citizens and training them in the ways of war, we will forge a National Reclamation Army, ready to reclaim what has been lost and crush all opposition."
HAN_march_for_the_nation:0 "March for the Nation"
HAN_march_for_the_nation_desc:0 "The National Reclamation Army cannot remain idle any longer. The time has come to march forward, to show our strength, and to rally the people under our banner. Each step we take strikes fear into our enemies and inspires loyalty among our allies. This march is not just for war — it is for the rebirth of the nation itself."
HAN_demandtherhineland:0 "Demand the Rhineland!"
HAN_demandtherhineland_desc:0 "The Rhineland is more than just territory — it is a symbol of strength and national pride. To leave it in foreign hands is to admit weakness, and the National Reclamation Army will not tolerate humiliation. By demanding its return, we send a clear message to the world: the days of submission are over, and the march of reclamation has begun."
HAN_arabsandlatinxs:0 "Arabs… AND LATINXS!?"
HAN_arabsandlatinxs_desc:0 "Reports have emerged of foreign elements — Arabs and Latinxs — moving within our borders, some seeking opportunity, others bringing dangerous ideas. To the National Reclamation Army, their presence raises alarm. Are they potential allies in the struggle, or threats to national purity? The debate rages, but one thing is certain: their existence cannot be ignored."
HAN_waydownsouth:0 "Way Down South…"
HAN_waydownsouth_desc:0 "Our struggle does not end at our current borders. Way down south, in the land of traitors, enemies plot against us and threaten the dream of a united nation. The National Reclamation Army must march boldly into these lands, punish the disloyal, and bring them under our rightful banner. Only then can the South be redeemed and restored to its proper place within the nation."
HAN_borkerletmetellyahewasbad:0 "Borker... Let me tell ya he was bad"
HAN_borkerletmetellyahewasbad_desc:0 "The stories of Borker’s rule are well known — corruption, betrayal, and weakness. His legacy lingers like a poison, and the National Reclamation Army cannot allow such decay to go unanswered. By denouncing him openly, we rally our people against his memory and prepare the way for his downfall. Borker may think himself untouchable, but history will remember him as nothing more than a failure."
HAN_return_to_the_fatherland:0 "Return To The Fatherland."
HAN_return_to_the_fatherland_desc:0 "For too long, our people have been scattered, our lands carved apart by traitors and foreign oppressors. Every mile stolen from us bleeds like an open wound, festering with humiliation and rage. But the Fatherland calls — it screams for vengeance, for reclamation, for justice. The time for hesitation is over. We will march with fire and iron, and those who stand in our way will drown in their own ruin. The Fatherland will be whole again, and its enemies will know fear."
HAN_waitthemagain:0 "Wait… Them Again?"
HAN_waitthemagain_desc:0 "History has a cruel way of repeating itself. Once more, the so-called Polish states rise to challenge us, clinging to lands that rightfully belong to the Fatherland. We will not suffer their defiance again. The National Reclamation Army shall march eastward, crush their pretensions, and erase their treachery once and for all. This time, there will be no second chances — only conquest."
